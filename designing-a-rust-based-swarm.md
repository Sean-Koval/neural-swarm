authorized orchestrator or peer agents can communicate with it. This prevents malicious interference or
eavesdropping on agent messages.
Coordination Strategy: We will implement a coordination loop roughly as follows:
Task Initialization: The orchestrator populates the blackboard with the initial problem description
and possibly an initial plan (if simple), then triggers the Planner agent (if one is used).
Planning Phase: The Planner writes a breakdown of tasks to the blackboard (e.g., list of modules or
steps). It might tag each sub-task with recommended agent types (e.g., “Coding” or “DataFetch”).
Task Assignment: The orchestrator reads the plan and launches the required number of agent
instances for each role (if not already running). Alternatively, some agents could be pre-started and
waiting idle. The orchestrator either assigns sub-tasks directly to specific agents (e.g., sends a
message “AgentX, do Task1”) or just relies on agents to pick tasks from the blackboard (agents can
look for unclaimed tasks on the board and claim them).
Parallel Execution: Multiple CodingAgents (or others) work in parallel on their respective tasks. Each
agent writes interim results to the blackboard. For example, a CodingAgent after completing a
function posts the code on the board (or commits to a shared repository and notes it on the board).
Synchronization: As soon as a piece of work is done and posted, other agents react. The
TestingAgent, upon seeing new code on the board, can retrieve it and run tests. If tests pass, it may
post a confirmation; if they fail, it posts error logs or feedback.
Iterative Refinement: If any agent (or the orchestrator) notices an issue (like a test failure or a
logical inconsistency in the plan), it can trigger a refinement. For instance, a Critic agent (if included)
could analyze outputs and suggest improvements or catch errors. The responsible agent (e.g., a
CodingAgent for a failed test) will then revise its output. This loop continues until consensus or
solution is reached – meaning no further changes needed and all tests pass.
Completion: The orchestrator monitors if the overall goal is achieved (e.g., all required modules
coded, all tests passing, documentation prepared). It then aggregates the results (final code,
documentation, etc.) from the blackboard. Agents are instructed to shut down (or they self-terminate
after completing their part). The orchestrator presents the final solution to the user and then can
flush the shared memory (since the swarm’s life ends with the problem).
This mechanism ensures efficient collaboration: Agents are not idle waiting for one another more than
necessary; many can work in parallel, yet the shared memory keeps their efforts aligned. The design also
supports a degree of fault-tolerance: if one agent crashes or fails, the orchestrator can detect this (lack of
heartbeat) and spin up a replacement agent, since all state is on the blackboard (the new agent can read
the latest state and resume). This stateless-agent model (state in environment, not in the agent) draws from
known multi-agent design principles where the environment holds the authoritative state .
Memory Management Strategy
As noted, memory is split into short-term shared context and long-term knowledge:
Shared Short-Term Memory: The blackboard is the primary short-term memory. It contains all the
data about the current problem – effectively the “working memory” of the agent swarm. Agents do
not have to store large context locally; they pull what they need from the blackboard when
executing. For example, before generating code, a CodingAgent will read the latest requirements or
designs from the board. This shared memory contains all historical context of the problem-solving

session (messages, partial solutions, outcomes) , so agents don’t need separate conversation
histories. (If using LLMs for agent reasoning, the prompt given to the LLM can be dynamically
constructed from the blackboard contents relevant to that agent’s task.)
Private Short-Term Memory: In some cases it’s useful for an agent to have a private scratchpad. For
instance, an agent might be running an LLM chain internally and not all intermediate LLM thoughts
need to be posted publicly until they’re confirmed. An agent’s isolated memory could simply be local
variables or an internal struct that isn’t shared. The design should allow this (for agent-specific
computations), but ultimately any result that matters to the overall problem should be written to the
shared memory so others can benefit. The blackboard architecture even allows private sections if
needed (areas only certain agents can access) , though initially we might keep everything
public for simplicity.
Long-Term Memory: For extended knowledge that persists across problems or provides context
from outside the current problem, we integrate a long-term memory store. This could be a vector
database, a file repository, or an MCP server providing semantic search over past data. Model
Context Protocol (MCP) is ideal for plugging in such memory: the agent swarm can include an MCP 
client component that connects to an external MCP server (such as Pieces or Mem0) which holds
persistent knowledge. For example, an agent can query an MCP server for “past design decisions” or
“domain-specific info” relevant to the task, and incorporate that into its reasoning. MCP is designed
to let AI agents fetch external context securely and uniformly . By supporting MCP, users
could hook up services like knowledge bases, documentation wikis, codebase indexes, etc., without
custom integration (MCP provides a standard API for these) . 
Memory Implementation: In Rust, the shared memory can be a globally accessible structure
protected by synchronization (e.g., using  Arc<RwLock<...>>  or actor messages). The data might
include structured entries (we could define types like  enum BlackboardEntry { Plan(...), 
CodeSnippet(...), TestResult(...) } ). Agents can filter relevant entries by type or tags. For
long-term memory, the system might provide a helper module that interfaces with an external
database. If an MCP server is used, the Rust orchestrator could make HTTP calls or use an SDK to
query it and then feed the results into the blackboard for agents to use. This separation ensures that
heavy or persistent data is not kept in RAM unnecessarily – it can be fetched on demand.
Garbage Collection and Limits: Since tasks may produce a lot of data on the blackboard, we should
have policies for memory management. The orchestrator can clean up intermediate data that is
superseded by newer results (or keep a full history if needed for traceability). If running on limited
memory, the blackboard could offload older entries to disk. Long-term memory queries should also
be used sparingly (e.g., only when an agent specifically needs more context) to remain efficient with
tokens if using LLMs.
In summary, the memory architecture combines a global shared store (like a blackboard, acting as the
short-term memory and communication medium) with optional persistent memory integration for long-
term knowledge. This approach is common in advanced multi-agent systems, where a knowledge base can
be both shared and local  – here the blackboard is the shared knowledge base, and each agent’s internal
state is its local memory. This design ensures agents have a common frame of reference while still allowing
private computation when needed.

Security and Isolation Considerations
Security is a first-class concern given that agents may execute code or handle sensitive data:
Memory Safety and Rust Guarantees: By implementing the system in Rust, we inherently avoid
many memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.). Rust’s safety and error-handling
features help prevent crashes and undefined behavior . This is important if agents are running
untrusted or AI-generated code – any rogue behavior is confined by Rust’s safety (and by the
sandboxing described below). Rust is also fast and efficient, meaning we can enable security
features without huge performance loss. The choice of Rust gives us a “secure-by-design” foundation
for the agent framework .
Sandboxing Code Execution: A standout feature is that agents might generate and run code (for
example, running unit tests on generated code, or executing a data pipeline). To protect the system
and host, all such execution should be sandboxed:
We can use WebAssembly (WASM) sandboxing. Rust code (or generated code in some languages)
can be compiled to WASM and executed in a limited environment (using engines like Wasmtime).
WASM sandboxing ensures the code cannot access the host system arbitrarily – it will only have
access to what we explicitly permit (e.g., no file system or network unless allowed). This provides a
lightweight, in-process sandbox. The memory isolation of WASM and the ability to set execution time
or memory limits is useful for containing potentially buggy or malicious code.
Alternatively, use Docker containers as sandboxes. For instance, if agents produce a Python script
or a binary program, the Testing agent could spin up a temporary Docker container that has no
access to the host except a specific volume for code, run the program there, then destroy the
container. This is heavier than WASM but allows testing in an environment closer to a real
deployment (with certain libraries, etc.). Kubernetes can manage such job containers if running in a
cluster.
In either case, the orchestrator should mediate any code execution. An agent intending to run code
would send a request (maybe via a tool-call interface) to something like an “execution manager”
which does the sandboxing.
Secure Communication: As mentioned, inter-agent comms on a network use TLS. We might
generate a key/cert pair for the orchestrator and have agents trust the orchestrator’s certificate (or
share a cluster secret for symmetric encryption). This ensures that even if the agent swarm is
distributed across machines or cloud nodes, eavesdropping on their message exchange is
prevented.
Authorization and Limits: Each agent should run with the principle of least privilege. For example,
if an agent doesn’t need internet access, we do not grant it. In Kubernetes, one can use network
policies to restrict egress for certain agent pods. If an agent only needs to access an internal API (like
the MCP server or a database), its container can be limited to only that endpoint. Within the Rust
program, we ensure that an agent’s capabilities are limited to what’s defined by its role. (If using
plugins/tools, the orchestrator should control which tools an agent is allowed to invoke.)
Auditing and Logging: The system should log agent actions and communications for debugging
and security auditing. Rust’s single-binary nature makes it easier to have a unified logging system.
The concept of “Agent Provenance” (tracking what each agent did) can be built in . This means
every change to the blackboard or any tool invocation can be recorded with the agent’s identity and
timestamp. Such logs both help in debugging the agent swarm’s decisions and also serve as an audit
trail in case something goes wrong or if we need to analyze how a solution was derived.

Fail-safes: If an agent starts acting erratically (e.g., looping endlessly or producing nonsense due to
an LLM hallucination), the orchestrator can terminate it and respawn a fresh instance. Timeouts
should be set for agent tasks. Rust’s concurrency allows us to use watchdog threads or async
timeouts to ensure no agent hogs resources indefinitely. In an extreme case, the orchestrator can
shut down the entire swarm if it detects a potential security issue or runaway condition, thereby
containing any damage.
By leveraging Rust and careful architecture, the system will be secure by default. Rust’s safety and the
planned isolation (both in memory and in execution context) guard against many risks. In essence, even if
one of the AI-driven agents tries something unintended, it’s confined within a sandboxed, well-monitored
environment – preventing the hypothetical “AI-pocalypse” by containing agents in controlled bounds .
Scalability and Deployment Modes
The tool is designed to run on a single machine or scale to a cluster:
Single-Machine Deployment: The simplest mode is running the entire system on one computer
(e.g., a developer’s laptop or a server). In this case, the orchestrator and agents might all run within
one OS process or a few processes. We can leverage Rust’s async and multithreading for
concurrency. For example, the orchestrator spawns each agent as a separate thread, or uses an
async runtime (Tokio) to run each agent as a task. Because Rust has no GIL and efficient threading,
multiple agents truly run in parallel on multiple cores . This allows utilizing all CPU cores for
different agents’ workloads. Memory sharing is straightforward (in-process via pointers or channels).
This mode is beneficial for low-latency communication between agents (no network overhead) and is
easier to debug. The entire system compiles into a single binary which can simply be executed on
the target machine – very low friction for deployment . Users can configure the number of
threads or agents according to their CPU/RAM limits.
Distributed (Cluster) Deployment: For heavier tasks or cloud-based use, the system can be
containerized. We can package the Rust binary (or binaries) into Docker images. There are a couple
of ways to architect the cluster deployment:
All-in-One Service: Run the orchestrator and agents within one container (essentially the single-
process model above) and let that container scale vertically (more CPU). This is simple but doesn’t
fully utilize multiple machines.
Microservices Model: Run the orchestrator as one service and each agent (or each type of agent) as
separate services/containers. For example, you might have a deployment of  orchestrator-
service , and separate deployments for  planner-agent ,  coder-agent ,  tester-agent , etc.
The orchestrator, upon needing an agent, could send a request to the appropriate agent service
(which could have multiple replicas behind a load balancer). This is more complex but allows
independent scaling – e.g., if coding tasks are the bottleneck, run more instances of the
CodingAgent service on the cluster. Communication in this model would be via HTTP/gRPC calls or
message queues. Kubernetes can manage the scaling and service discovery between these
components.
On-Demand Containers: Leverage Kubernetes Jobs or temporary containers for agents. The
orchestrator (running as a service) can use the Kubernetes API to spawn a Job or Deployment for an
agent swarm when a task starts. Each agent comes up in its own container/pod, does its work, and
terminates. This model truly treats agents as ephemeral. It adds some overhead (container startup

time), but for long-running tasks that might be acceptable, and it gives maximum isolation (each
agent in its own pod) plus the ability to distribute across nodes.
In a cloud scenario, using Kubernetes offers benefits like automated restart of crashed pods, scaling based
on load, and isolation of resources. For example, one could pin certain agents to GPU-equipped nodes (if
one agent type needed a GPU for ML inference) while others run on CPU nodes.
State Management in Cluster:  When distributed, the blackboard can be a  shared data store
accessible to all agents. We could implement it as an in-memory data grid or simply use a
lightweight database that all agents can reach (for instance, a Redis instance or a PostgreSQL,
depending on the needed complexity). The choice might depend on the data size and access
patterns: if the data is mostly text (prompts, code), a document store or even a git repository could
hold it (though real-time coordination via git is tricky). A key-value store like Redis (with pub/sub)
might be an elegant solution: agents post data to Redis and subscribe to channels for updates. Redis
can be secured with passwords and network policies within the cluster.
Low Resource Environments: The design remains usable on modest hardware. Because agents can
be threads in one process, even a single-CPU machine can time-slice between agents using async
(Tokio can schedule tasks cooperatively). If memory is limited, one can limit the number of agents or
have them work more sequentially. The Rust binary can be compiled in release mode for efficiency
and will have a relatively small memory footprint (especially compared to Python-based solutions,
which might require tens or hundreds of MBs for the runtime overhead). We will also make
components optional – e.g., if long-term memory (MCP integration) is not needed, it can be turned
off to save resources (no need to run a separate memory server or store embeddings).
Extensibility and Maintainability: By having a clear separation of components, the tool/repository
will be maintainable and extensible. For instance, if in the future we want to add a new type of agent
(say an “AI code reviewer” that adds comments to code), we can do so by implementing the Agent
trait for that role and updating the orchestrator’s configuration. The use of Rust traits and generics
can make adding new tools or agent capabilities straightforward, while keeping type safety. Rust’s
powerful macro system could even be used to reduce boilerplate when defining new agent message
types or logging routines .
Auditable Single Binary: Deploying a Rust service is simplified by the fact that it can be a single
binary   with   all   functionality   included .   This   is   advantageous   for   both   cloud   and   edge
deployments. On Kubernetes, the container image just needs that binary (no need for a heavy
runtime). On a single machine, the user doesn’t have to install a runtime or dozens of Python
packages – they just run the binary. This also reduces the attack surface and avoids dependency
breakage issues. The binary can be scanned and audited for security since it’s self-contained and
consistent across environments . 
In essence, the system can start as a single-machine application for simplicity and then evolve into a
cloud-native distributed system  as needed, without major architectural changes. Thanks to Rust’s
efficiency and cross-platform compilation, the same codebase can target both scenarios. Kubernetes and
Docker are leveraged as needed to provide scaling and isolation, but are not mandatory for basic usage.
This flexibility meets the requirement of running “on a single computer” and also being deployable to cloud
clusters (with Docker/K8s as the backbone for multi-node deployments).

Integration of External Tools (MCP and Plugins)
To solve complex problems, agents often need to use external tools or services beyond their own logic. Our
design incorporates a tool interface to allow this extensibility in a controlled way. Key points include:
Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration: As mentioned, MCP is an emerging standard for
connecting AI agents to external data and actions. By implementing an MCP client within our
framework, we immediately gain access to a wide range of existing tools and extensions that speak
MCP . For example, an MCP server might provide long-term memory, as well as other
capabilities like retrieving emails, querying a knowledge base, or even controlling a web browser.
Rather than reinvent each integration, our agents can invoke MCP calls. In practice, this means if an
agent’s task says “search the knowledge base about X”, the orchestrator/agent translates that into an
MCP call (which might be an HTTP request to an MCP server listening on a port). The result comes
back (e.g. relevant data) and is then placed on the blackboard for agents to use. MCP is secure and
scalable, and saves us from writing custom adapters for each external API . We just need to
follow the MCP protocol format and use available SDKs or direct HTTP calls. The user can configure
the addresses of MCP servers (for memory, for tools, etc.) in a config file.
Custom Tools and APIs: Not everything will have an MCP server (especially user-specific internal
tools). So, the framework will also allow registering custom tool handlers. We can define a trait like 
Tool  with a method  execute(params) -> Result  and allow agents to call  Tool  by name.
For instance, if a user wants the agents to be able to run database queries, they might implement a
Tool that connects to their database. The agent (likely via the LLM’s reasoning or a hard-coded call)
would invoke  Tool("database_query", "SELECT ...") , and the orchestrator would route this
to the actual tool implementation, then return the result to the agent or blackboard. This resembles
the function calling mechanism in frameworks like OpenAI’s function API, but implemented in Rust. In
fact, if using an LLM, the agent’s prompt can list available tools (including ones backed by MCP or
custom Rust code), and the LLM’s output can indicate which tool to use. The orchestrator then
interprets that and calls the appropriate function in Rust. This design was inspired by approaches in
other agent frameworks which let LLMs choose functions instead of hardcoding rules . The
difference here is we ensure these calls are executed by safe Rust code.
Examples of Tool Extensions: Besides memory, we could have tools for:
Code Compilation/Execution: A tool that compiles a given code snippet and returns any errors (this
could simply invoke  rustc  or  gcc  on sandboxed code, or use an online compiler API).
Web Requests: If the agent needs to fetch data from the web (for example, to get documentation or
verify something online), a tool could be provided (with caution) to perform HTTP GET requests. This
would be tightly controlled (maybe only allowed to certain domains) for security.
Data Pipeline Operations: For tasks involving data processing, tools might interface with data sources
or processing libraries. For instance, an agent might call a “run Spark job” tool or a “query CSV
dataset” tool. The user can integrate their data processing engines through such hooks.
DevOps/Cloud Tools: If the problem involves deploying the code, an agent could use a tool to interact
with Docker or Kubernetes (e.g., building an image, deploying a service). These would execute real
commands but under supervision.
Configurable and Sandbox Tools: All tools can be enabled/disabled via configuration. If a user
doesn’t want agents to have internet access, they simply don’t provide the WebRequest tool or don’t
configure an MCP server that can browse. This way, the “swarm” the user spins up is tailored to the

problem domain and security context they want. Tools themselves should be designed securely. For
example, if providing a shell command tool, it should sanitize inputs or run the command in a safe
environment to avoid injection issues.
Logging and Monitoring of Tool Use: The orchestrator will log every tool invocation (which agent
called what tool with what parameters). This transparency is important, especially if agents are
autonomous – the user needs to know what actions were taken on their behalf. MCP calls, for
instance, are essentially tool calls that will be logged as well (MCP’s design itself emphasizes that the
AI app decides when to call a tool, often after the LLM suggests it ). We’ll make those steps
visible in logs or UI.
By designing around a pluggable tool interface, we make the agent swarm highly extensible. Users or
developers can continuously augment the system with new capabilities as new needs arise. Want agents to
produce a UML diagram of the planned system? Add a “DiagramTool” that can render diagrams from a
description. Because our framework is in Rust, many existing libraries (for database access, HTTP, etc.) can
be integrated as tools. And the use of MCP where possible means we align with an ecosystem of tools that
are already being built for AI agents, future-proofing the design .
Example Workflow: Building an API Service
To illustrate how all these pieces come together, consider a user asks the agent swarm to "Build a REST API
for a TODO list application". Below is a possible workflow with our design:
User Input & Orchestrator Kickoff: The user provides the problem description to the orchestrator
(perhaps via a CLI or web UI that wraps the orchestrator). The orchestrator creates a new 
blackboard for this task and records the problem details. It then spawns a Planner Agent to
strategize.
Planning Agent Activity: The Planner Agent reads the problem from the blackboard. Using an LLM
(with a system prompt like "You are a software architect"), it generates a plan: e.g. "We need: (a) Data
Model for TODO items, (b) API Endpoint for creating a TODO, (c) Endpoint for listing todos, (d) Endpoint for
marking complete, (e) basic documentation." This plan (a list of tasks or modules) is written to the
blackboard . The planner might also suggest which agent type should do each (marking some for
"Coder", one for "DocAgent", etc.). 
Orchestrator Spawns Coding Agents: Seeing the plan, the orchestrator starts (or awakens) multiple
Coding Agents – e.g., one for the Data Model and one for each API endpoint. It provides each agent
with the relevant task description (from the plan) either via a targeted message or by each agent
picking an unclaimed task from the blackboard. For instance, CodingAgent1 is assigned "Implement
the data model and database integration", CodingAgent2 gets "Implement create_todo endpoint",
etc. All coding agents have access to the overall plan on the blackboard, which gives context.
Coding Agents Generate Code: Each Coding Agent uses its logic to produce code for its
assignment. Suppose we integrate OpenAI’s API or another LLM: the agent’s code could involve
prompting the LLM with the task (and any relevant schema or language requirements). The LLM’s
output (the code) is then possibly reviewed by the agent (to fix small errors) and posted to the
blackboard as a code snippet. In practice, we might have the agent directly commit to a git
repository and then note the commit hash on the blackboard. For simplicity, imagine each agent
writes a chunk of code to the shared memory with a label (e.g., "data_model.rs", "api_create.rs").

Parallel Development: The agents work in parallel (thanks to our multi-threaded setup). While the
Data Model agent is designing the database schema, the Endpoint agents start writing controller
logic. They might all need the definition of the data model. In our design, the Data Model agent can
publish an interim interface spec on the blackboard (like a struct definition for a TODO item) once
ready, so that others can use it. Because the blackboard is globally visible, the CreateEndpoint agent
sees that and incorporates it. In case a coding agent needs something not yet present (say
endpoints need the data model which is still being coded), agents could either wait or the
orchestrator can orchestrate the order (e.g., start Data Model agent slightly before others, or have
them communicate if blocking).
Testing Agent Validation: As soon as any code is posted, the Testing Agent kicks in. The Testing
Agent retrieves the current code (all components) from the blackboard. It might generate some test
cases automatically (possibly via an LLM prompt like "Write unit tests for the API") or use predefined
tests if provided. Then it uses the sandbox execution module to run the tests. For example, it
compiles the code inside a WASM runtime or docker container. Suppose the test for "create_todo"
fails because of a bug. The Testing Agent posts the test results (with an error trace) onto the
blackboard.
Feedback Loop: The CodingAgent responsible for that part sees the test failure on the blackboard. It
then goes back to fix the code. This may involve calling the LLM with the error message to suggest a
fix, or the agent’s own logic adjusting the code. The updated code is posted again. This iterative loop
continues until tests pass for all features. Throughout this, all agents see the evolving state: for
instance, another agent (say a Reviewer Agent if present) could also comment on code quality. If we
had a “Critic” agent, it might read the code and point out potential improvements, writing those
suggestions on the board for coding agents to consider (this is similar to an agent debating or
refining on the blackboard, which is supported by the blackboard approach ).
Documentation Agent Finalizes Docs: Meanwhile, a Documentation Agent has been waiting for
the overall implementation to stabilize. Once the core code is in place (or as it’s being produced), the
Doc Agent reads the code from the blackboard and generates documentation. For example, it might
produce a README with instructions on how to use the API, or inline doc comments for each
endpoint function. It uses an LLM tuned for summarizing code or a template-based approach to
format the documentation. The output is placed on the blackboard (e.g., "API_DOC.md" content).
Completion and Tear-down: When the orchestrator observes that all tasks are completed (all code
sections done, tests passing, docs written), it triggers a final step. It might have a Build Agent do
one final integration (like making sure all modules compile together, packaging the project). The
orchestrator then gathers the final artifacts: the source code files, documentation, maybe a compiled
binary of the service. It presents these to the user (perhaps zipping them up or pushing to a
repository). Finally, the orchestrator signals all agents to terminate. They shut down gracefully,
freeing memory. The blackboard for that project can be archived or cleared. The entire swarm that
was launched for the problem now spins down, fulfilling the requirement that agents live only for
the duration of the problem.
Throughout this process, if we had integrated an external MCP memory, say the user had relevant past
notes about TODO apps, an agent could have queried that at the start. For instance, the Planner Agent
might call a memory tool: "Recall if the user had any preferences for this API". The MCP server could return a
snippet from last week’s conversation about using PostgreSQL, which the planner would then include in the
plan (ensuring the data model uses Postgres). This would have been seamlessly done via our tool interface
to MCP.

This example demonstrates how multiple agents with different roles cooperate: planning, coding, testing,
documenting – all in parallel and orchestrated via a shared memory and central coordinator. Problems are
broken down and solved faster than a single agent could do sequentially, and the design ensures they can
run on one machine or many. Each agent had some short-term memory (their current subtask and any
intermediate LLM thoughts) and shared everything useful on the board for others. The result is a fully
implemented piece of software (the API) along with tests and docs, achieved by an ephemeral swarm of
agents that was spun up on demand and then spun down.
Conclusion
We have outlined a comprehensive design for a Rust-based tool that enables spinning up a swarm of
intelligent agents to collaboratively solve programming tasks (and extendable to many other tasks). The
design emphasizes:
Robust architecture: A central orchestrator with a shared blackboard for coordination, enabling
agents with specialized roles to work together efficiently .
Secure, efficient implementation: Rust provides speed and memory safety, important for running
untrusted code and multi-threaded workloads . The use of sandboxing (WASM/containers) and
encrypted communication further ensures security.
Memory and communication model: A hybrid memory approach with global shared context and
optional private state meets the needs of collaboration without losing individual agent utility .
Communication is handled through structured message passing and shared state, allowing for
parallelism and clear information flow.
Scalability: The solution scales from a single laptop to a Kubernetes cluster. It can exploit multi-core
CPUs on one machine, and multiple nodes in cloud, orchestrated via Docker/K8s. The Rust “single
binary” deployment model eases this portability .
Extensibility with tools: By integrating with the Model Context Protocol and providing a plugin
interface, the agent swarm can use external tools and long-term memory stores on demand .
This makes the system adaptable to various domains (coding, data processing, etc.) simply by
configuring different tools or agents.
Parallel problem solving: The framework inherently supports dividing work among agents (e.g.
different coding tasks, or concurrently handling parts of a data pipeline). This yields efficient
problem solving, as seen in the example where multiple parts of the project were built
simultaneously.
In summary, this design leverages the best of modern multi-agent system ideas (like blackboard
architectures and function-driven AI agents) implemented with Rust’s strengths (performance, safety,
concurrency). The result is a  flexible, secure, and powerful agent-swarm framework. Users can
instantiate a swarm tailored to their problem, confident that the agents will communicate and cooperate
effectively, all while running within resource-friendly bounds on their hardware. By following this blueprint,
one could proceed to implement the system as an open-source Rust repository, enabling developers to
solve complex tasks through dynamic swarms of specialized AI agents
