```rust
use neural_swarm::tests::{
    run_comprehensive_neural_swarm_validation,
    ValidationTestRunner,
    QualityGateConfig
};

// Run with default quality gates
let report = run_comprehensive_neural_swarm_validation().await;

    else
      echo "‚ùå Quality gates failed"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase test duration in configuration
2. **Resource Constraints**: Adjust memory/CPU limits for test environment
3. **Network Issues**: Configure network latency and loss parameters
4. **Consensus Failures**: Check node connectivity and timing parameters

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```rust
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test validation_test_runner
```

### Performance Debugging

For performance issues, run individual performance tests:

```bash
cargo test performance_reliability_validation::execute_load_test
cargo test performance_reliability_validation::execute_stress_test
```

## Best Practices

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Isolated Environment**: Run tests in dedicated environment
2. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate CPU/memory for test loads
3. **Network Configuration**: Configure realistic network conditions
4. **Clean State**: Reset system state between test runs

### Test Development

1. **Modular Design**: Keep tests focused and independent
2. **Configurable Parameters**: Make thresholds and timeouts configurable
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test both success and failure scenarios
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish and maintain performance baselines

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Trend Analysis**: Track test results over time
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on system evolution
3. **Test Coverage**: Continuously expand test coverage
4. **Automation**: Automate test execution and reporting
