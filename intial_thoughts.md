🎯 Key Enhancements
Built-in MCP Tools Library

Include a suite of ready-to-use MCP connector tools: Filesystem, GitHub, Postgres, HTTP API, Notion, Slack, etc.

These tools enable agents to read/write files, interact with repositories, access databases, make web requests, and more—all standard MCP functionality. MCP is rapidly being adopted by major AI ecosystems, making this a future-ready feature 

.

Hooks System (Pre/Post Operation)

Agents can invoke pre-tool and post-tool hooks for validation, formatting, auditing, logging, notifications, and more.

Inspired by frameworks like Claude Code, this ensures deterministic behavior and developer control around tool invocations

Modules
MCP Tools Module

Embedded set of reference MCP servers/clients: Filesystem, GitHub, Postgres, HTTP, Notion, Slack, etc.

Agents access these tools via an MCP client library. Easily extended with new tools

Hooks Module

Define hook events (e.g., PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCodeExec, PostCodeExec)

Developers can register Rust closures or scripts to execute at these points (e.g., run rustfmt, send notification, verify code security)

.

Orchestrator & Agent Core

Unchanged from previous design: agents operate around a shared blackboard, with secure orchestration and optional optional A2A communication.

Execution & Sandbox Manager

Choice of WASM or Docker sandboxing for safe code execution remains unchanged.

📐 Hook Lifecycle Flow
Example: “Insert code via GitHub MCP tool”

Agent initiates create_github_file(tool_params)

PreToolUse hook runs: e.g. validate branch name, scan for malware

Tool executes via MCP client/server

PostToolUse hook runs: e.g. run clippy, prettify code, log operation, notify Slack

This deterministic hook pipeline gives you both automation and control over agent actions

✅ Summary: What This Gains
Out-of-the-box tooling: Agents can immediately leverage common MCP tools (e.g., commit code, query DB, fetch web data).

Workflow control: Hooks let you enforce policies, formatting, or automation around agent work.

Security & auditability: Hooks ensure visibility into what agents do before and after tool calls.

Modular extension: New tools or hooks can be added via clear plugin patterns.

🚀 Next Steps
Implement MCP module with key connectors (Filesystem, GitHub).

Design hook framework: define event types, registration API, and execution order.

Integrate hooks into orchestrator: call hooks on each tool invocation.

Provide example projects: e.g., build a CLI that formats generated code using prettier or rustfmt via hooks.

With these, your agent swarm framework becomes enterprise-ready—feature-rich, secure, and extensible—while staying lean and efficient in Rust. Let me know if you'd like help designing hook APIs or selecting initial
